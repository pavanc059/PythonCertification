* if-else statement: more conditional execution
* Nested if-else statements :First, consider the case where the instruction placed after the if is another if
* elif statement : elif is used to check more than just one condition, and to stop when the first statement which is true is found.
  * you  **mustn't use `else` without a preceding `if`** ;
  * `else` is always the  **last branch of the cascade** , regardless of whether you've used `elif` or not;
  * `else` is an **optional** part of the cascade, and may be omitted;
  * if there is an else branch in the cascade, only one of all the branches is executed;
  * if there is no else branch, it's possible that none of the available branches is executed.
