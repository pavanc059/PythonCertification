# PythonCertification

This Project is intended to prepare you to attend python entry level to advanced certification exams

```
Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.

## Python Interpreter

The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command

- Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix(^D), Control-Z on Windows(^Z)) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().
- The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library. The default configuration also saves your history into a file named .python_history in your user directory.
- One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which features tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management. It can also be thoroughly customized and embedded into other applications. Another similar enhanced interactive environment is [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/downloads.html).
- when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.
- A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command and to invoke module python -m module [arg] ... Examples will be found in pythonTips MD file.
- When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.
- [command line options](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#using-on-general)
