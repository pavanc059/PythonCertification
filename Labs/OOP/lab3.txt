    improving the student's skills in operating with special methods

Scenario

    Create a class representing a time interval;
    the class should implement its own method for addition, subtraction on time interval class objects;
    the class should implement its own method for multiplication of time interval class objects by an integer-type value;
    the __init__ method should be based on keywords to allow accurate and convenient object initialization, but limit it to hours, minutes, and seconds parameters;
    the __str__ method should return an HH:MM:SS string, where HH represents hours, MM represents minutes and SS represents the seconds attributes of the time interval object;
    check the argument type, and in case of a mismatch, raise a TypeError exception.
