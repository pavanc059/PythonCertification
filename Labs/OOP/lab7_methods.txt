Scenario:
    Create a class representing a luxury watch;
    The class should allow you to hold a number of watches created in the watches_created class variable. The number could be fetched using a class method named get_number_of_watches_created;
    the class may allow you to create a watch with a dedicated engraving (text). As this is an extra option, the watch with the engraving should be created using an alternative constructor (a class method), as a regular __init__ method should not allow ordering engravings;
    the regular __init__ method should only increase the value of the appropriate class variable;

The text intended to be engraved should follow some restrictions:

    it should not be longer than 40 characters;
    it should consist of alphanumerical characters, so no space characters are allowed;
    if the text does not comply with restrictions, an exception should be raised;

before engraving the desired text, the text should be validated against restrictions using a dedicated static method.

    Create a watch with no engraving
    Create a watch with correct text for engraving
    Try to create a watch with incorrect text, like 'foo@baz.com'. Handle the exception
    After each watch is created, call class method to see if the counter variable was increased
