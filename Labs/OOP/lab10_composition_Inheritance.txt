    improving the student's skills in operating with inheritance and composition

Scenario

Imagine that you are an automotive fan, and you are able to build a car from a limited set of components.

Your task is to :

    define classes representing:
        tires (as a bundle needed by a car to operate); methods available: get_pressure(), pump(); attribute available: size
        engine; methods available: start(), stop(), get_state(); attribute available: fuel type
        vehicle; method available: __init__(VIN, engine, tires); attribute available: VIN
    based on the classes defined above, create the following objects:
        two sets of tires: city tires (size: 15), off-road tires (size: 18)
        two engines: electric engine, petrol engine
    instantiate two objects representing cars:
        the first one is a city car, built of an electric engine and city tires
        the second one is an all-terrain car build of a petrol engine and off-road tires
    play with the cars by calling methods responsible for interaction with components.
