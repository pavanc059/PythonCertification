# create custome squences and mappings using magic methods like __getitem__ and __len__ to make them behave like built-in sequences and mappings.
# implement following methods .__getitem__(), __len__() .__contains__() and __reversed__()
# .__getitem__() - Access elements using indexing and slicing. like my_sequence[0] or my_sequence[1:4]
# .__len__() - Return the number of elements in the sequence or mapping. like len(my_sequence)
# .__contains__() - Check if an element exists in the sequence or mapping. like 3 in my_sequence
# .__reversed__() - Return an iterator that iterates over the elements in reverse order. like reversed(my_sequence)
