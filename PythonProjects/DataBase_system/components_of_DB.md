1.  **Storage Management:** This system is responsible for physically storing the data on disk (or other storage media).  It handles:

    *   **File Organization:** How data is structured and organized in files (e.g., heap files, B-tree indexed files).
    *   **Space Management:** Allocating and managing disk space, including dealing with fragmentation.
    *   **Buffer Management:** Caching frequently accessed data in memory (the buffer pool) to improve performance.  Strategies for replacing data in the buffer pool (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used) are crucial.
    *   **I/O Management:** Handling read and write operations to the disk.

2.  **Query Processing:** This system takes user queries (typically in SQL) and translates them into a form that the database can understand and execute efficiently. It involves:

    *   **Parsing and Syntax Checking:** Verifying that the query is syntactically correct.
    *   **Query Optimization:** Finding the most efficient execution plan for the query. This involves considering different access methods (e.g., using indexes), join algorithms, and the order of operations.  Query optimizers are a key component of a database system's performance.
    *   **Execution:** Carrying out the optimized plan to retrieve the requested data.

3.  **Transaction Management:** This system ensures data consistency and integrity, especially in the face of concurrent access and failures. Key concepts include:

    *   **ACID Properties:** Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (maintains database constraints), Isolation (transactions appear to run independently), Durability (changes are persistent).
    *   **Concurrency Control:** Managing simultaneous access to the database by multiple users or applications. Techniques like locking, optimistic concurrency control, and timestamping are used.
    *   **Recovery:** Handling system crashes or other failures and restoring the database to a consistent state.  Write-ahead logging is a common technique used for recovery.

4.  **Data Dictionary (Metadata Management):** This system stores information *about* the data in the database. It includes:

    *   **Schema Information:** Definitions of tables, columns, data types, constraints, indexes, views, etc.
    *   **User Information:** Details about database users, their permissions, and roles.
    *   **Statistics:** Information about the data distribution, which is used by the query optimizer.

5.  **Security Management:** This system controls access to the database and protects it from unauthorized use. It includes:

    *   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users.
    *   **Authorization:** Granting and revoking permissions to users.
    *   **Auditing:** Tracking database activity for security and compliance purposes.

6.  **Communication Management:** This system handles communication between the database and users or applications.  It includes:

    *   **Network Protocols:** Supporting various network protocols for client-server communication.
    *   **API (Application Programming Interface):** Providing interfaces for applications to interact with the database (e.g., ODBC, JDBC).

These core systems are interconnected and work together to provide the functionality of a database management system (DBMS).  The specific implementation details of each system can vary significantly between different database products (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
