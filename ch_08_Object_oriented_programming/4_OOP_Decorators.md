## Decorators

A decorator is one of the design patterns that describes the structure of related objects. Python is able to decorate functions, methods, and classes.

- The decorator's operation is based on wrapping the original function with a new "decorating" function (or class), hence the name "decoration". This is done by passing the original function (i.e., the decorated function) as a parameter to the decorating function so that the decorating function can call the passed function. The decorating function returns a function that can be called later. 
- Decorators are used to perform operations before and after a call to a wrapped object or even to prevent its execution, depending on the circumstances. As a result, we can change the operation of the packaged object without directly modifying it. 
- Decorators are used in:
  - the validation of arguments;
  - the modification of arguments;
  - the modification of returned objects;
  - the measurement of execution time;
  - message logging;
  - thread synchronization;
  - code refactorization;
  - caching.
- operations are performed on object names;
- this is the most important thing to remember: the name of the simple_function object ceases to indicate the object representing our simple_function() and from that moment on it indicates the object returned by the decorator, the simple_decorator. 
```python
def simple_decorator(function):
    print('We are about to call "{}"'.format(function.__name__))
    return function


@simple_decorator
def simple_hello():
    print("Hello from simple function!")


simple_hello()
```
#### Decorators should be universal

Consider a function that accepts arguments and should also be decorated. Decorators, which should be universal, must support any function, regardless of the number and type of arguments passed. In such a situation, we can use the *args and **kwargs concepts. We can also employ a closure technique to persist arguments.
```python
def simple_decorator(own_function):

    def internal_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print('"{}" was called with the following arguments'.format(own_function.__name__))
        print('\t{}\n\t{}\n'.format(args, kwargs))
        own_function(*args, **kwargs)
        print('Decorator is still operating')

    return internal_wrapper


@simple_decorator
def combiner(*args, **kwargs):
    print("\tHello from the decorated function; received arguments:", args, kwargs)

combiner('a', 'b', exec='yes')
```

#### Decorators can accept their own attributes
In Python, we can create a decorator with arguments.
```python
def warehouse_decorator(material):
    def wrapper(our_function):
        def internal_wrapper(*args):
            print('<strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from {} with {}'.format(our_function.__name__, material))
            our_function(*args)
            print()
        return internal_wrapper
    return wrapper


@warehouse_decorator('kraft')
def pack_books(*args):
    print("We'll pack books:", args)


@warehouse_decorator('foil')
def pack_toys(*args):
    print("We'll pack toys:", args)


@warehouse_decorator('cardboard')
def pack_fruits(*args):
    print("We'll pack fruits:", args)


pack_books('Alice in Wonderland', 'Winnie the Pooh')
pack_toys('doll', 'car')
pack_fruits('plum', 'pear')
```
- The warehouse_decorator() function created in this way has become much more flexible and universal than 'simple_decorator', because it can handle different materials.

`Note that our decorator is enriched with one more function to make it able to handle arguments at all call levels.`

- The pack_books function will be executed as follows:
  - the warehouse_decorator('kraft') function will return the wrapper function;
  - the returned wrapper function will take the function it is supposed to decorate as an argument;
  - the wrapper function will return the internal_wrapper function, which adds new functionality (material display) and runs the decorated function.

- The biggest advantage of decorators is now clearly visible:
  - we donâ€™t have to change every 'pack' function to display the material being used;
  - we just have to add a simple one liner in front of each function definition.

#### Decorator stacking

Python allows you to apply multiple decorators to a callable object (function, method or class). 

- The most important thing to remember is the order in which the decorators are listed in your code, because it determines the order of the executed decorators. When your function is decorated with multiple decorators:
```python
@outer_decorator
@inner_decorator
def function():
    pass

abcd = subject_matter_function()

```
The call sequence will look like the following:
  - the outer_decorator is called to call the inner_decorator, then the inner_decorator calls your function;
  - when your function ends it execution, the inner_decorator takes over control, and after it finishes its execution, the outer_decorator is able to finish its job.

example :
```python
def big_container(collective_material):
    def wrapper(our_function):
        def internal_wrapper(*args):
            our_function(*args)
            print('<strong>*</strong> The whole order would be packed with', collective_material)
            print()
        return internal_wrapper
    return wrapper

def warehouse_decorator(material):
    def wrapper(our_function):
        def internal_wrapper(*args):
            our_function(*args)
            print('<strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from {} with {}'.format(our_function.__name__, material))
        return internal_wrapper
    return wrapper

@big_container('plain cardboard')
@warehouse_decorator('bubble foil')
def pack_books(*args):
    print("We'll pack books:", args)

@big_container('colourful cardboard')
@warehouse_decorator('foil')
def pack_toys(*args):
    print("We'll pack toys:", args)

@big_container('strong cardboard')
@warehouse_decorator('cardboard')
def pack_fruits(*args):
    print("We'll pack fruits:", args)


pack_books('Alice in Wonderland', 'Winnie the Pooh')
pack_toys('doll', 'car')
pack_fruits('plum', 'pear')

#Output 
# We'll pack books: ('Alice in Wonderland', 'Winnie the Pooh')
# <strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from pack_books with bubble foil
# <strong>*</strong> The whole order would be packed with plain cardboard

# We'll pack toys: ('doll', 'car')
# <strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from pack_toys with foil
# <strong>*</strong> The whole order would be packed with colourful cardboard

# We'll pack fruits: ('plum', 'pear')
# <strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from pack_fruits with cardboard
# <strong>*</strong> The whole order would be packed with strong cardboard
```

#### Decorating functions with classes

A decorator does not have to be a function. In Python, it could be a class that plays the role of a decorator as a function.

- We can define a decorator as a class, and in order to do that, we have to use a `__call__` special class method. When a user needs to create an object that acts as a function (i.e., it is callable) then the function decorator needs to return an object that is callable, so the `__call__` special method will be very useful.

```python
class SimpleDecorator:
    def __init__(self, own_function):
        self.func = own_function

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print('"{}" was called with the following arguments'.format(self.func.__name__))
        print('\t{}\n\t{}\n'.format(args, kwargs))
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        print('Decorator is still operating')
        return result


@SimpleDecorator
def combiner(*args, **kwargs):
    print("\tHello from the decorated function; received arguments:", args, kwargs)


combiner('a', 'b', exec='yes')
```

#### Decorators with arguments
```python
class WarehouseDecorator:
    def __init__(self, material):
        self.material = material

    def __call__(self, own_function):
        def internal_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print('<strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from {} with {}'.format(own_function.__name__, self.material))
            own_function(*args, **kwargs)
            print()
        return internal_wrapper


@WarehouseDecorator('kraft')
def pack_books(*args):
    print("We'll pack books:", args)


@WarehouseDecorator('foil')
def pack_toys(*args):
    print("We'll pack toys:", args)


@WarehouseDecorator('cardboard')
def pack_fruits(*args):
    print("We'll pack fruits:", args)


pack_books('Alice in Wonderland', 'Winnie the Pooh')
pack_toys('doll', 'car')
pack_fruits('plum', 'pear')
```

When you pass arguments to the decorator, the decorator mechanism behaves quite differently than presented in example of decorator that does not accept arguments:
  - the reference to function to be decorated is passed to `__call__` method which is called only once during decoration process
  - the decorator arguments are passed to `__init__` method

#### Class decorators

Class decorators strongly refer to function decorators, because they use the same syntax and implement the same concepts.

- Instead of wrapping individual methods with function decorators, class decorators are ways to manage classes or wrap special method calls into additional logic that manages or extends instances that are created.
- If we consider syntax, class decorators appear just before the 'class' instructions that begin the class definition (similar to function decorators, they appear just before the function definitions).
```python
@my_decorator
class MyClass:

obj = MyClass()

'======================='

def my_decorator(A):
   ...

class MyClass:
   ...

MyClass = my_decorator(MyClass())

obj = MyClass()
```

- Like function decorators, the new (decorated) class is available under the name 'MyClass' and is used to create an instance. The original class named 'MyClass' is no longer available in your name space. The callable object returned by the class decorator creates and returns a new instance of the original class, extended in some way.

A class decorated with a function that allows us to monitor the fact that some code gets access to the class object attributes. When youâ€™re debugging your code or optimizing it, you might be curious how many times the object attributes are accessed. In such a situation, a class decorator might be handy.

```python
def object_counter(class_):
    class_.__getattr__orig = class_.__getattribute__

    def new_getattr(self, name):
        if name == 'mileage':
            print('We noticed that the mileage attribute was read')
        return class_.__getattr__orig(self, name)

    class_.__getattribute__ = new_getattr
    return class_

@object_counter
class Car:
    def __init__(self, VIN):
        self.mileage = 0
        self.VIN = VIN

car = Car('ABC123')
print('The mileage is', car.mileage)
print('The VIN is', car.VIN)

```
- line 1: def object_counter(class_): â€“ this line defines a decorating function that accepts one parameter 'class_' (note the underscore)
- line 2: class_.__getattr__orig = class_.__getattribute__ â€“ the decorator makes a copy of the reference to the __getattribute__ special method. This method is responsible for returning the attribute values. The reference to this original method will be used in a modified method;
- line 4: def new_getattr(self, name): â€“ a definition of the method playing the role of the new __getattribute__ method starts here. This method accepts an attribute name â€“ itâ€™s a string;
- line 5: if name == 'mileage': â€“ in case some code asks for the 'mileage' attribute, the next line will be executed;
- line 6: print('We noticed that the mileage attribute was read') â€“ a simple alert is issued;
- line 7: return class_.__getattr__orig(self, name) â€“ the original method __getattribute__ referenced by class.__getattr__orig is called. This ends the 'new_getattr' function definition;
- line 9: class_.__getattribute__ = new_getattr â€“ now the 'new_getattr' is defined, so it can now be referenced as the new '__getattribute__' method by a decorated class;
- line 10: return class_ â€“ every well behaved and developed decorator should return the decorated object â€“ in our case it is a decorated class.
